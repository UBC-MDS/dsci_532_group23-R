### Milestone 3 Reflection

In this milestone, with R we were able to roughly replicate the heroku app we deployed in Python. We got the World map and bar plot interactive with the year slider and the energy type dropdown. The line plot on the bottom is controlled by the Country select dropdown menu. 

What we did not manage to complete was adding in the per capita values that we had for our Python version. We were also not able to remove the underscores from the energy type selections. Both of these we could not complete due to the time restrictions of the busy quiz week and with trouble switching between languages. Another difference was the location of the drop down menus have changed as it was particularly difficult to get the html configuration sorted when switching to a new language. 

Re-doing everything we have done in milestone 2 in R proved to be a challenge especially with the busy quiz week taking up the majority of the time. If we had more time, I am sure we would have been able to get this implmentation of the dashboard to where our milestone 2 dashboard is at.
